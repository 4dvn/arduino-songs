Tunes for playing on Arduino boards.

## Usage

Every tune here should run on every arduino board without problems. This uses the tone() function from Arduino, what makes this only monophonic. On the bright side, libraries are not required.

## Hardware

Just connect an piezo buzzer to the board and you are good to go. Pin 11 is used in every sketch because a piezo buzzer can be connected between it and the close GND pin without any wiring.

## Why this?

I have been learning sight reading and thought this would help. Every sketch here has been written by myself, although based on scores I found online.
