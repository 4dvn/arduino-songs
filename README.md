# arduino-music
Tunes for playing on Arduino boards.

## Usage

Every code here should run on every arduino board without problems. This uses the tone() function from Arduino, what makes this only monophonic. On the bright side, **libraries are not required**.

## Hardware

Just connect an piezo buzzer to the board and you are good to go. Pin 11 is used in every sketch because a piezo buzzer can be connected between it and the close GND pin without any wiring.

## Why this?

I have been learning sight reading and thought this would help.

Every sketch here has been written by myself, although based on scores I found online. These scores are linked in eah file. 
I only kindly ask that you give credit if you use these codes on a tutorial, video, etc.
