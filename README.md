Tunes for playing on Arduino boards

## Usage

Every tune here is monofonic and can be run on any arduino without need of extra libraries.

Just connect an piezo buzzer to the board and you are good to go.

## Why this?

I have been learning sight reading and thought this would help. Every sketch here has been written by myself, although based on scores I found online.
